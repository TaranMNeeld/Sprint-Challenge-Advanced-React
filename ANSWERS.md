Answer:
1. Mounting Phase - This is when you initialize state inside of your component, render your component, and add some basic rules or functionality to your current state.

2. Updating Phase - This is when you manipulate the state of your component, which can then update your component and re-render it.

3. Unmounting Phase - This is when you remove your component from the app. This is based on the apps current state, and it will clean up any unnecessary data.
